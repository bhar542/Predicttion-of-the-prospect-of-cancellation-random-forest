# Predicttion-of-the-prospect-of-cancellation-random-forest
In this particular project, we are using the Hotel_Booking dataset that contains 
information like hotel, meal, country, meal, adult, children deposit type etc 
and using that to predict the chances of cancellation.
However, before you go ahead and make predictions, it is advised that you first 
pre-process and study the data, since it may contain some irregularities and 
noise.
